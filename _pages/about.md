My name is Lawrence and I am a Network Engineer with a passion for NetDevOps. I originally embarked on this journey to learn how to automate the configuration, management, testing and deployment of my company's network infrastructure, only to fall in love with writing code for infrastructure.

I am a regular user of Linux, having used it as my main operating system for several years now, as well as being my preferred choice for System Administration. With the majority of my time having been spent with Juniper hardware.

I'm a lover of open source technologies. 

And an aspirant pythonista with still plenty to learn **>:D**
